On Friday night, join other TransportationCamp attendees for an optional, informal “tweet up”, from 7pm.

Put some faces to the names you've been chatting with [on the Topics page](http://transportationcamp.org/topics) and in the lively [#transpo discussions on Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23transpo). Or maybe you want to tell stories from the [afternoon's tours](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/join-a-tour-and-see-transpo-tech-behind-the-scenes/), or start pitching your session ideas for the weekend. Whatever you feel like, we'll see you on Friday!
