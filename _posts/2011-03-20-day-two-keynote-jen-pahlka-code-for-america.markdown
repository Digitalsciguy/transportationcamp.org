[Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) founder Jennifer Pahlka spoke Sunday morning at TransportationCamp West about her experience working with government agencies on opening data streams, as well as Code for America's mission to build open-source applications for cities.

TransportationCamp has truly benefitted from the ever-present Code for America fellows.  They showed up en mass to the Third Thursdays kickoff happy hour, led variety of #Transpo sessions over the weekend, and even authored an Ignite talk (a great one on a car-free family from Aaron Ogle).

Note to friends of #Transpo:  Code for America is currently accepting applications for 2012 Fellowships.  [Apply today](http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/) and maybe tomorrow you too can look this cool.
