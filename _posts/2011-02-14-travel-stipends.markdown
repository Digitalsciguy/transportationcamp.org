**UPDATE: All travel stipends are spoken for, thank you for your interest. If you put in an application, you will hear back by Thur, 2/24.**

Thinking of attending TransportationCamp but worried about lodging or travel expenses?

A very limited number of travel stipends (of $500 each) are available to **students, non-profit or government representatives** who would like to attend TransportationCamp.

If you would like to request a travel stipend, please email janetti AT openplans DOT org, with the subject line "TransportationCamp Travel Stipend Request." Â Assistance requests for both EAST and WEST events are available until filled, on a first-come, first-serve basis.

We can't wait to see you at TransportationCamp!
