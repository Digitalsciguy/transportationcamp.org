TransportationCamp is returning to DC!

On January 12 2013, meet thinkers and doers at the intersection of transportation and technology. Get ready to talk and learn about improving mobility, information design methods, bike share systems, and more... It's an [unconference](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/) - it's up to you.

Registration is open! Sign up [here](http://transpocampdc13.eventbrite.com/).

The event will be on Saturday before the start of the [Transportation Research Board 92nd Annual Meeting](http://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting2013/AnnualMeeting2013.aspx).

We're excited to be hosted by the GMU School of Public Policy, at GMU Founders Hall, 3351 Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22201.

The location is easy to get to:



	
  * Founders Hall is located two blocks east of the Virginia Square Metro Station (Orange Line).

	
  * Two Capital Bikeshare stations are also within two blocks, at Virginia Square Metro and at Fairfax Dr/Wilson Blvd.

	
  * Metro bus 38B runs from K St, NW and Georgetown.
