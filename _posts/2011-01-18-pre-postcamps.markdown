TransportationCamp is too big for just NYC and SF. If you are attending some of the big transportation conferences this Winter, we want to meet you and bring you into this community, whether you can attend one of the official TransporationCamps or not.

OpenPlans staff will be at [TRB](http://www.trb.org) and [Transforming Transportation](www.embarq.org/en/transforming-transportation-2011) in DC next week, and we will be at [APTA TransITech](http://www.apta.com/mc/transitech/Pages/default.aspx) in Miami at the end of March. In each city we will host a Tweet-up in a local bar or restaurant for members of the TransportationCamp community to get together and talk about how Web 2.0 technologies are intersecting with transportation. More details to follow but ping me (mkeating at openplans dot org) to stay in the loop.

Looking forward to meeting all of you!

**UPDATE**: We will have the DC Tweet-up co-incident with the [Young Professionals in Transportation](http://ypt.transportation.org/) Happy Hour and Tweet-up on Monday night (the 24th) from 5:30 to 7:30 atÂ Stone's Throw Bar Marriott Wardman Park, [2660 Woodley Road NW, Washington, DC 20008](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2660+Woodley+Road+NW,+Washington,+DC+20008&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=2660+Woodley+Rd+NW,+Washington,+District+of+Columbia,+20008&gl=us&t=h&z=16).
