Following on the success of [previous Transportation Camps](http://transportationcamp.org/dc/), TransportationCamp DC '14 will continue to expand the opportunities we have to improve mobility through recent advances in technology, such as web 2.0, mobile computing, open source software, open data and APIs, and spatial analysis.
