TransportationCamp-ers have a chance to “get real” next weekend at TransportationCamp East.  In a rare opportunity to go behind the scenes with New York's transportation, we're offering four different tours, vising three control centers and a rail depot!

Signup for these tours opens **Monday 2/28 at 11am ET**. Details below, check back here for sign up links. We don’t have many spaces, so get ready to register... Pick wisely, the tours overlap so you can’t go on all of them.

TransportationCamp gratefully acknowledges tour support from NYCDOT, the MTA, and Clear Channel. We're especially grateful to the staff who will lead the tours!

For all tours, meeting point information will be available once registration opens. Full details will be given to successful applicants. Tour spots are only available to registered TransportationCamp attendees.
