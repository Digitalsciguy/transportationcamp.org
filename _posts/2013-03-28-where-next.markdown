TransportationCamp rocked DC and Atlanta already this year ([here's a great roundup](http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2013/02/13/transportationcamp-south-is-a-wonks-heaven)) , and we're excited to keep the momentum going with more events.

Look out for news of a return to the west coast soon. We're looking for partners for another east coast camp -- [get in touch](http://openplans.org/contact/) if you're interested.
