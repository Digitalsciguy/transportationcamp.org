One of the suggestions that's come in for TransportationCamp is to build glossary of transportation tech terms, since there is a fair amount of technical language.

Bibiana McHugh, IT Manager for GIS at [TriMet](http://trimet.org) writes in with the following links that offer a good starting point:



	
  * [TransModel Appendix A](http://www.transmodel.org/en/cadre1.html)

	
  * [NYSDOT Next Generation Transit Service Portal Glossary
](http://ngtsip.pbworks.com/w/page/12503386/Glossary)

	
  * [FTA Location Referencing Guidebook Appendix J ](http://www.fta.dot.gov/documents/LRG_FinalPublication.pdf)

	
  * [TriMetâ€™s Transit Terms](http://developer.trimet.org/definitions.shtml)

	
  * [Practice Standard for Scheduling Glossary](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-and-development/project-management/9781930699847)


Thanks Bibiana!
