John writes on the challenges for [Designing Transportation for 2060](http://opentransportation.tumblr.com/post/3596787531/designing-transportation-for-2060):


> Is it enough to think in terms of higher density systems, faster systems, smarter systems, more efficient systems?  Those are definitely a good start, but do they go far enough?  Do we need to think more outside the box, play with more variables, really reinvent transportation?  What does successful transportation look like in 2060 in your city?



Adam writes on [the intimidating nature of bus networks](http://opentransportation.tumblr.com/post/3597586280/bus-networks-are-by-their-nature-so-intimidating-to):


> There are an awful lot of people, everywhere around us, in every city, who have difficulty negotiating the mobility (and other) systems that are supposed to serve their needs. As far as I’m concerned, anyway, it is the proper and maybe even the primary task of the urban systems designer to work with compassion and fearless empathy to address this difficulty.




Shin-pei writes [about policy, and bridging gaps](http://opentransportation.tumblr.com/post/3596923882/upcoming-transportationcamp-do-not-miss). She includes a rallying call for TransportationCamp attendees:


> Conversations between people of all backgrounds who have come together to work on focused, shared problems is how innovation happens. This is particularly important when tackling structural issues, like the US transportation system. Every incremental collaborative step is a move towards fixing it. Now, let’s get to work.
