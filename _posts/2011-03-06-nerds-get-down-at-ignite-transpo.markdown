It was a long, stimulating day at TransportationCamp East, but that didn't stop a capacity crowd showing up for RedHat's Ignite #Transpo talks at We Work Lounge.

Ignite #Transpo hostess Shin-pei Tsay (Transportation Carbon and Deficit Reduction at the Carnegie Endowment   for International Peace) started things off with a warm, jovial welcome and moved directly into the first few speakers:  [Andy Palanisamy](http://www.linkedin.com/in/transportgooru) got things rolling with hilarious immigrant perspectives on the US and transportation in **Coming to America. **

Alex Bell reeled the audience in a little by talking about cheaper solutions to real time arrival data with** Not perfect, but good enough? Cheaper solutions to transit problems.**

Then [Francisca Rojas](http://harvard.academia.edu/FranciscaRojas) (below) shared her research on the state of user generated data in transportation agencies across the nation in **Transit Transparency: A Real Time Action Cycle.**

[Marcus Bowman](http://twitter.com/#!/3gmobility) (below) was on next, throwing hilarious random references ([Jet Pack Man](http://www.google.com/images?q=jet+pack+man+yves&hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=UXv&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&prmd=ivns&source=lnms&tbs=isch:1&ei=T6BzTY6QMYqV0QHrm8jFAQ&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&cd=2&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=1112&bih=528)!) into an energetic and entertaining argument for harder/better/faster/stronger progress in mobility in **Transportation: Evolution to Revolution.**

Ana Bayne (Allegheny County Transit Council) "went factoid" with **What Transit is about and  … What’s market research got to do with it? **Then NYC DOT's Neil Freeman demonstrated his very nimble social media success story, a tumblr blog account of the New York City pothole season in **Making Potholes Cool.**

Transportation engineer and data connoisseur [Chris Pangilinan](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=17603255&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=7HjO&locale=en_US&srchid=c6302dad-a6fc-4c18-9b2d-bedb5f03858f-0&srchindex=2&srchtotal=11&pvs=ps&pohelp=&goback=.fps_*1_Chris_Pangilinan_*1_*1_*1_*1_*51_*1_Y_*1_*1_*1_false_1_R_true_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2) assaulted current transportation planning, saying it's like "driving with the headlights off."  Chris challenged the developers in the room to make change with **Transforming Transportation in a Sea of Data**.

"Professional futurist" [Garry Golden](http://www.garrygolden.net/) ended the show with lots of David Hasselhoff references in **From Driver to Captain**, bravely suggesting that we channel the Night Rider car a little bit more** **when we envision (and build!) future #transpo systems.** ** (David Hasselhoff?!)**
