Truly torrential downpour did not stop TransportationCamp West's day one Ignite talk + party at Automattic Lounge.

Many thanks again to our MC, Josette Melchor from Gray Area Foundation  for the Arts (below), our [seven great presenters](transportationcamp.org/ignite), and our open bar sponsor, Red  Hat.
