As Saturday approaches, take a moment or two to check our our [Essential Guide to TransportationCamp](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/). You'll find details of the unconference model, the session board, and useful tips on proposing and leading sessions...

For example, here's the section on creating a compelling sticky note - an essential part of the Camp experience:


> Show up at TransportationCamp with your session in mind. Head to the board, grab a sticky note, and describe your session. Donâ€™t be shy about it!  You are interesting and your work is compelling and people will want to hear what you have to share. Your note must include:

>   * Session title
>   * Your name
>   * What kind of session it is (presentation, brainstorm, Q&A, demos, hacking...)
>   * More info about the session -- will it be technical? are you open to co-presenting?

It helps if your sticky note is compelling (not just legible). Here are a couple of great examples:

Whether you're coming to TransportationCamp for the first time, or an unconferences veteran, hopefully you'll find the [Essential Guide](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/) useful. See you on Saturday!
