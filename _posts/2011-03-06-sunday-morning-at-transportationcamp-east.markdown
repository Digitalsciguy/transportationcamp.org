Sunday's TransportationCamp [program](http://transportationcamp.org/east) got off to a civilized mid-morning start.

Kick-off topics in Session Five ranged from **Networked vehicle systems** (led by [@weeels](http://twitter.com/weeels)) to **Can we do a road pricing system for really cheap with existing tech?**. Georgia Bullen drew a capacity crowd for a **Data vis and policy **session.

Adam Davidson led a discussion on **How can technology change mobility?** (below), exploring how rapid advances in transactional technology have improved our transportation options, like car and bike sharing.

[Tara Green](http://twitter.com/#!/search/hsrusa) presented at **High-speed rail: social media, marketing and mapping**, kicking off a really interesting discussion about public perception and the highly charged politics around funding high speed rail.

A technical debate ensued about open source tools, hacking, APIs, and data formats at **Tools for small and medium agencies, part 2.**
