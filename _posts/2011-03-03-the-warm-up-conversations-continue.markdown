The TransportationCamp buzz continues, with great discussions [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23transpo) and [the Topics page](http://transportationcamp.org/topics).  We're especially excited to see longer blog posts --  today's crop includes a discussion of "real time", the future of the smart city, and some reflections on information tech and transportation equality. If you want to participate, [submit to Open Transportation](http://opentransportation.tumblr.com/submit), or let us know that you're blogging elsewhere.



### [What’s holding up “real time”? Costs and standards.](http://opentransportation.tumblr.com/post/3620907071/whats-holding-up-real-time-costs-and-standards)



[Brian Ferris](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/bdferris/) of [OneBusAway](http://onebusaway.org/ ) fame writes on the two hold-ups to real time bus info: cost and standards.



> From riders to developers to transit agencies, it’s hard to find anyone who wouldn’t agree that we should be pushing for real-time in all forms, and with good reason.  Real-time transit info for riders has all sorts of positive impacts: increased satisfaction, decreased wait times, improved perception of safety, and ultimately more trips made using public transit.  So what’s the hold up?  There are two big issues at play: cost and standards. 

### [There is a battle brewing over the future of the smart city.](http://opentransportation.tumblr.com/post/3620910060/there-is-a-battle-brewing-over-the-future-of-the-smart)



[Anthony Townsend](http://www.iftf.org/user/20) from the [Institute for the Future](http://www.iftf.org/) gives us his take on the looming issues around data, tech and regulation, and what it all means for the smart city.



> What the struggle is over is how we structure the relationship between ourselves, the data about us, and the technological and regulatory frameworks that govern its use. TransportationCamp is going to be ground zero for rethinking open of the most important urban datascapes - the raw feeds about how we move as individuals, collectively, both at once and over time.





### [Information Technology and Transportation Equality](http://opentransportation.tumblr.com/post/3609481941/information-technology-and-transportation-equality)


OpenPlans' own Kevin Webb reflects on the history of inequality in transportation provision, and the lessons we should take as we design the future.



> Information technology presents new opportunities and challenges for improving transportation access. Web-based mapping solutions and the proliferation of mobile applications allow us to rethink the very nature of our transportation infrastructure. All of a sudden highways and the single-occupancy vehicles that travel them become platforms for ad hoc, point-to-point transit networks; interactive trip planning tools simplify and advertise traditional fixed-route transit systems;  and, information networks themselves allow us to reconsider how we connect with one another and define the boundaries of our communities.
