The 3rd Annual TransportationCamp Washington DC will be held on Saturday, January 11, 2014. [Click here to register](https://transpocampdc14.eventbrite.com/).

Following on the success of [previous Transportation Camps](http://transportationcamp.org/dc/), TransportationCamp DC '14 will continue to expand the opportunities we have to improve mobility through recent advances in technology, such as web 2.0, mobile computing, open source software, open data and APIs, and spatial analysis. The conference will also examine ways to build connections between disparate innovators in public administration, transportation operations, information design, and software engineering.

The event will be on Saturday before the start of the [Transportation Research Board 93rd Annual Meeting](http://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting2014/AnnualMeeting2014.aspx).

We're excited to be hosted by the GMU School of Public Policy, at GMU Founders Hall, 3351 Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22201.

The location is easy to get to:




  * Founders Hall is located two blocks east of the Virginia Square Metro Station (Orange Line).


  * Two Capital Bikeshare stations are also within two blocks, at Virginia Square Metro and at Fairfax Dr/Wilson Blvd.


  * Metro bus 38B runs from K St, NW and Georgetown.
