## Schedule and event notes
See [Transportation Camp DC 2015 Sessions & Notes
](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Red8OH09U0wJOIBjZXsJeB3xLbmi0kJJkqKYOweQbM0/edit?usp=sharing) for a list of all sessions and links for notes. The notes are on shared documents that everyone is encouraged to edit (in real time). If you're in a session and mention a link, it's a good idea to add the link to the notes for that session.

The event hashtag is [#transpo](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23transpo&src=typd&f=realtime). We'll be projecting real-time tweets in the multi-purpose room.

## Share your ideas!
TransportationCamp attendees are submitting ideas on the Twitter [collaboration site.](http://ideas.transportationcamp.org). Some fascinating discussions are underway, and the list keeps growing. Any of those topics can become a session at Camp, if someone is willing to lead it.

Review the list and help the best topics become sessions. Leave responses and use the “support this” button to let others know what topics are hot. If something grabs your attention or gets you worked up, blog about it and post a link.

Bring your ideas to expand the opportunities we have to improve mobility through recent advances in technology, such as web 2.0, mobile computing, open source software, open data and APIs, and spatial analysis. Participants will also examine ways to build connections between disparate innovators in public administration, transportation operations, information design, and software engineering.
