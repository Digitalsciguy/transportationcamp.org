<h1><center>The industry's first virtual conference is prepared for another great year on April 10, 2021!</center></h1>

![Scenes from TransportationCamp PHL 2019](/events/phl2018/Scenes%20from%20TCPHL18.jpg)

Whether you work in the industry or simply have an interest, we welcome you [in spirit] to our nation's birthplace at the center of the NEC for a day filled with ideas at the intersection of transportation, technology, and urbanism. As always, the participant-driven TransportationCamp conference series follows the "unconference" format, lending itself to a more pertinent, thought-provoking, and active event.

This is not your normal conference. **And it's NOT some webinars on a Saturday.**

Organized by passionate Philadelphians in conjunction with the Philadelphia chapters of Young Professionals in Transportation (YPT) and Women’s Transportation Seminar (WTS), and Drexel University’s Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation, we look forward to seeing you! [Connect with us](#connect)

## <a name="Logistics"></a> Logistics

Last year, we challenged the status quo by proving you can have a successful and engaging event from the safety and comfort of home, in spite of having to pivot a mere few weeks before the event date. Based upon the current state of the pandemic, **we are planning to have another fully-virtual conference on April 10, 2021**.

**We are also planning the first-ever TCPHL Summer Gathering, an optional outdoor extension of the virtual conference** focused on urban exploration and an open-air happy hour as weather improves and restrictions lift. Details TBD.

## <a name="firsttime"></a> First Time at a TransportationCamp?

Despite being virtual, this event will still follow the standard guidelines and practices from a normal TransportationCamp event. Here are some details.

- **How To TransportationCamp**: The folks at MobilityLab have taken the time to put together a [TransportationCamp 101 guide](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/) that explains all aspects of the event.
- **Participation Encouraged**: Sessions are formed as the day goes on, so be sure to come with topics for discussion. If you have an idea, feel free to share and add your thoughts.
- **Rule of Two <s>Feet</s> Clicks:** Never hesitate to leave a session if you suddenly find it's not for you, or if there's another session that you want to check out, too!
- **Dress Code**: TransportationCamp has always been a very casual event, especially via the virtual format. We've always said, your best attire is your coolest transportation tee shirt!

## Organizing Committee

TransportationCamp PHL is organized thanks to a collaborative effort between YPT, WTS, and Drexel's Lindy Institute. Passionate about transportation and bringing the conference to Philadelphia, the conference's co-chairs span a diverse array of subsets in the industry with professional experience in both public and private transportation operations, transportation planning, and logistics consulting. For additional breadth, the conference has a larger working group whose collective knowledge and expertise spans all facets of the industry and includes all levels of transportation involvement (ranging from career professionals to engaged hobbyists).


## <a name="scholarship"></a> The TCPHL Academic Innovation Award

Returning for a second year, TransportationCamp PHL is pleased to announce the **2021 TransportationCamp PHL Academic Innovation Award presented by David Klahr Consulting**! This award, the first of its kind ever offered by a TransportationCamp when introduced in 2020, challenges students to prepare a response to the following prompt:

> Transportation networks are becoming increasingly integrated, with multimodal journeys representing a much larger portion of individual mode choice. Some modes provide robust interoperability in payment systems, such as E-ZPass which can be used by an automobile anywhere in the Northeast. Others, such as transit systems, are typically restricted by mode and operator (e.g. SEPTA Key), limiting integration with counterpart networks.
> 
> What can the Philadelphia region do right now with existing real-world systems and resources to make this work better?  What actionable changes would you implement in this region, and why? How would these changes promote integrated mobility solutions?

Write a 2-4 page double-spaced essay or provide a similar written work (e.g. slide deck) in PDF format. Please ensure your entire submission inclusive of all materials does not exceed 10 slides/pages.

Due to the impact of recent storms, the deadline has been extended to **March 15, 2021.** Submit your entry via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSch14g_2RnTaq1cdmHLVbTJcFA3ozxlnGeQwKfm_ec-OPLT2w/viewform); you will be prompted to log in to a google account if you are not already. **The winner shall receive the award, free admission to a future in-person conference, and a generous $500 scholarship!**
