As discussed prior to TransportationCamp PHL 2021, **the TCPHL21 team is pleased to be hosting an optional extension of the conference — the TCPHL 2021 Summer Gathering — on Saturday, July 24, 2021**. The gathering will be an opportunity for TransportationCamp participants to interact with one another in an in-person setting, accounting for the improved global pandemic conditions.

Additional details will be shared in the coming weeks, but you can expect a day of fun urban exploration with fellow TransportationCamp participants, concluding with a happy hour in the afternoon.

Philadelphia makes for a great day trip from New York, Washington, Baltimore, and more — and Amtrak tickets are starting at $16 from all of those locations!

> *Suggested Amtrak Trains on 7/24:*
> 
> - Regional 164 from Washington & Baltimore, arriving 11:04am
> - Keystone 664 from Harrisburg & Lancaster, arriving 11:15am
> - Keystone 663 from New York, arriving 10:35am
> - Acela 2249 from New York & Boston, arriving 11:15am

Are you a local or looking to make a long weekend out of it? We'll be sharing some additional event suggestions for making the most of the region.

## Organizing Committee

TransportationCamp PHL is organized thanks to a collaborative effort between YPT, WTS, and Drexel's Lindy Institute. Passionate about transportation and bringing the conference to Philadelphia, the conference's co-chairs span a diverse array of subsets in the industry with professional experience in both public and private transportation operations, transportation planning, and logistics consulting. For additional breadth, the conference has a larger working group whose collective knowledge and expertise spans all facets of the industry and includes all levels of transportation involvement (ranging from career professionals to engaged hobbyists).
