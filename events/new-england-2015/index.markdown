The 2nd Annual Transportation Camp New England will be held on Saturday, April 11, 2015. Following on the success of last year's Transportation Camp, TransportationCamp New England ’15 will continue to examine ways to build connections between disparate innovators in public administration, transportation planning, transportation operations, information design, and software engineering. 

This year, TransportationCamp 2015 is specifically working to assemble planners, dreamers, programmers, students, and professionals in an equal setting that will foster change and develop new relationships between the merging fields of transportation and technology. We look to ask and answer questions – What is happening? What are you doing? What can you learn? What can you change?

The “unconference” is designed to bring together transportation professionals, technologists, and others interested in the intersection of urban transportation and technology. Anyone who wants to improve mobility is welcome.
