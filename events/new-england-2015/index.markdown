The 2nd Annual Transportation Camp New England will be held on Saturday, April 11, 2015.
Following on the success of last year's Transportation Camp, TransportationCamp New England ’15 will continue to examine ways to build connections between disparate innovators in public administration, transportation planning, transportation operations, information design, and software engineering.

The “unconference” is designed to bring together transportation professionals, technologists, and others interested in the intersection of urban transportation and technology.
