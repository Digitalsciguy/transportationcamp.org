TransportationCamp California 2015 is a partnership with [CalACT](https://www.calact.org/home), the California Association for Coordinated Transportation, to bring together diverse views and perspectives on public transportation. The event will take place on Tuesday, October 20, 2015, the first day of the CalACT Fall conference in Rohnert Park, California. By hosting TransportationCamp at their semi-annual conference, CalACT is helping to create a unique TransportationCamp atmosphere, where technologists, advocates, and riders can come together in open conversation with the operators of California’s small, rural, and specialized public transit providers.

Though it will take place during a conference, the event will be run as a standard “unconference” &mdash; sessions will be proposed on the day of the event, and will range in transportation topics based on the interest of the attendees.

Transportation Camp California will be held at the [DoubleTree hotel in Rohnert Park](http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/california/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-sonoma-wine-country-RLSC-DT/index.html), California beginning at 10 AM on October 20, 2015 (coffee and networking begin at 9 AM). Lunch and coffee will be included in the registration fee of $25.
