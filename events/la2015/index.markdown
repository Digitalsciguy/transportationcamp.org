Come to TransportationCamp Los Angeles 2015 if you’re a technologist who aspires to analyze and visualize public open data or
build apps that connect people with mobility options. Come if you’re a transportation professional with a thorough awareness of the multimodal transportation system’s shortcomings
and a desire to work collaboratively and creatively to improve it.

As an unconference, the session topics and activities are proposed by the attendees;
every attendee is a participant in shaping and leading the event. Registration includes admission to the Camp, lunch, and refreshments. Note that attendance is limited to
about 140 and we expect to sell out several weeks ahead of the event.

TransportationCamp will be held October 3, 2015 at the [UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs](http://luskin.ucla.edu/),
in the Public Affairs Building (651 Charles E Young Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90095).
