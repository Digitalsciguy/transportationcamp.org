Do you have creative ideas for how Boulder,
Metro Denver & Colorado can grow and move more sustainably?
Do you wish Colorado had more ride/bike/carsharing, open data, mobility apps and transit­oriented development?
Then TransportationCamp Colorado 2016 is for you. On <b>Sunday, May 15, 2016</b>,
the inaugural TransportationCamp Colorado will bring together a community of like­minded people interested in
discussing and collaborating on innovative solutions to Colorado’s transportation challenges.

### Goal

<img float=right align=right width=192 height=96 src="tcco.jpg">We aim to gather urban planners,
software developers, data scientists, engineers,
designers, entrepreneurs, students, officials,and innovators for an exciting “un­conference”.
Unlike a traditional conference, at TransportationCamp the breakout session topics are determined by the participants,
based on their interests and skills. This provides a unique opportunity for you to contribute to and shape the event.
Bring your ideas and lead a session!


### Schedule

The tentative plan is to start at 8am, break for lunch and wrap­up by 5pm.
Happy hour to follow.

### Venue

TransportationCamp Colorado will be held at [Galvanize Boulder](http://www.galvanize.com/campuses/boulder-west-pearl/),
1035 Pearl Street, Boulder, CO.
