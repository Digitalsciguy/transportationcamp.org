**New! Data Challenge**

We’re including a data challenge in [TransportationCamp CO](http://transportationcamp.org/events/colorado-2016/). Data enthusiasts are invited to explore various open datasets and develop a cool, visually inspiring data analysis of any part of the Colorado transportation system.  There will be an afternoon breakout session where participants can present their solutions.

Here are some datasets to help get you started:
* Boulder BCycle – 2011–2015 trip data [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l32w80hhcbqcsm3/Boulder%20B-cycle%20May%202011-December%202015%20Trip%20Data.xlsx?dl=0);
* Denver BCycle – 2010-2015 trip data [here](https://denver.bcycle.com/company);
* Open Colorado – various city, county & state datasets [here](http://data.opencolorado.org/);
* Colorado Information Marketplace - Colorado transportation data [here](https://us-mg6.mail.yahoo.com/neo/data.colorado.gov/browse).

Here are two examples of similar data challenges to help provide ideas and get your creative juices flowing:
[Hubway Data Visualization Challenge](http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/) and
[Chicago Bike Equity](http://www.stevevance.net/slowrollchicago/).  Good luck! We are excited to see what you come up with.
