TransportationCamp is an **[unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)** - every session is **planned, proposed, and led by attendees like you**. It&#39;s the perfect opportunity to share your transportation passion with a diverse gathering of fellow enthusiasts. TransportationCamp welcomes all attendees, whether you&#39;re a planner, software developer, engineer, student, transportation professional, community member, policy maker, or just excited about mobility!

<h3>First Time at a TransportationCamp?</h3>

- **Participation Encouraged:** Sessions are formed as the day goes on, so be sure to come with topics for discussion. If you have an idea, feel free to share and add your thoughts.
- **Rule of Two Clicks:** Never hesitate to leave a session if you suddenly find it&#39;s not for you, or if there&#39;s another session that you want to check out, too!
