Following on the success of [the sold-out inaugural event](http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2013/02/13/transportationcamp-south-is-a-wonks-heaven) in February 2013, TranspotationCamp South is returning to Atlanta in April 2014.

This year, we are joining forces with [Govathon](http://govathon.com/) and [Code for Atlanta](http://www.codeforatlanta.org/) to produce a one-of-a-kind combined event that will see TransportationCamp run concurrently with a transportation-focused civic hackathon. While participants will register for either TransportationCamp or Govathon, joint brainstorming sessions will be held Saturday morning, and attendees are encouraged to "float" between both events' activities for the duration of the weekend. The result will be a series of tangible, technology-based solutions to our most pressing transportation challenges. 

## Registration

Register online at [transpocamp-govathon.eventbrite.com](https://transpocamp-govathon.eventbrite.com). The collaboration page is coming soon. Follow us on Twitter for the latest updates at [@TranspoCampSo](https://twitter.com/transpocampso).

## Venue

The venue for both TransportationCamp South and Govathon is the [Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons](http://clough.gatech.edu/), a state-of-the-art educational facility located at the heart of the Georgia Tech campus. A happy hour hosted by [Young Professionals in Transportation - Atlanta](http://yptransportation.org/chapters/atlanta/) will follow TransportationCamp on Saturday (Location TBD).
