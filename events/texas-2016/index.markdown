TransportationCamp Texas 2016, a partnership with the [American Society Civil Engineers](http://www.asce.org/) and
the [Houston](http://yptransportation.org/chapters/ypt-houston/) and
[Austin](http://yptransportation.org/category/chapters/ypt-austin-chapter/) Chapters of
the [Young Professionals in Transportation](http://yptransportation.org/),
aims to bring together diverse views and perspectives on pressing transportation issues in Texas.
The event will take place on Sunday, Jun. 26, 2016, the first day of
the [ASCE International Conference on Transportation and Development’s Spring conference](http://www.asce-ictd.org/)
in Houston, Texas. By hosting TransportationCamp at their semi-annual conference, YPT and ASCE
are helping to create a unique TransportationCamp atmosphere, where technologists, transportation advocates,
and users can come together in open conversation with the operators of Texas’ transportation providers.

Though it will take place during a conference,
the event will be run as a standard “unconference” — sessions will be proposed on the day of the event,
and will range in transportation topics based on the interest of the attendees.

Transportation Camp Texas will be held at the 
[Omni Houston Galleria hotel](http://www.asce-ictd.org/ictd-lodging-and-transportation/) located in Houston,
Texas beginning at 10 AM on June 26, 2016 (coffee and networking begin at 9 AM).
Coffee will be included in the registration fee of $25, but guests will be expected to provide lunch on their own.

Registration is now open, at [asce-ictd.org/transportationcamp](http://www.asce-ictd.org/transportationcamp/).
