Hosted in conjunction with the [Pro Walk Pro Bike Pro Place Conference](http://walkbikeplaces.org/), [YPT Vancouver](https://yptransportation.org/ypt-vancouver-bc/)
is bringing Transportation Camp to Vancouver this fall. Come connect with a diverse
range of transportation professionals and enthusiasts, both young and young at heart!

### What is Transportation Camp?

Transportation Camp brings together people interested in all aspects of
transportation and provides attendees with the unique opportunity to propose, lead
and shape sessions.

There will be multiple rounds of sessions with different topics, group sizes, and
formats which are all proposed and led by attendees themselves;

* Attendees can join and propose any session they’re interested in;
* Sessions can take the form of a presentation, group discussion, Q+A, workshop etc.; and
* The unconference format fosters open and engaging conversations about transportation.

### Potential topics include:

* Uber and public ride sharing;
* Emerging technology in transportation (driverless vehicles, electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, etc.);
* Advocacy responsibilities for transportation professionals;
* Youth engagement in transportation;
* The role of technology in transportation (tolls, fare collection, Uber, “the Internet of things”, big data);
* You and your career in transportation (Mentorship);
* Transit Oriented Development;
* Sustainable Transportation and Land Use;
* Road Safety; and
* Any other transportation topic you feel passionate about!

Transportation Camp is perfect for attendees who want to generate ideas, talk about
topics they feel passionate about, or inspire others in the field of transportation!
