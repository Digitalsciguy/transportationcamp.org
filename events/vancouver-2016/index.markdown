The 2016 [Canadian Institute of Transportation Engineers (CITE)](https://www.cite7.org/) annual conference will be held in Kelowna, BC this year from June 5-8th. [YPT Vancouver](https://yptransportation.org/ypt-vancouver-bc/) is excited to announce that we will be hosting an Unconference session on Tuesday, June 7th.

What is an unconference?

* There will be multiple rounds of sessions with different topics, group sizes, and formats which are all proposed by attendees themselves;
* Attendees can join and propose any session they’re interested in;
* Sessions can take the form of a presentation, group discussion, Q+A, workshop etc.; and
* The unconference format fosters open and engaging conversations about transportation.

Do you have a burning transportation topic you want to talk about? Want to learn more about what other people and agencies are doing in transportation?  This unconference will provide you with a unique opportunity to propose, lead and shape sessions.

Potential topics include:

* Uber and public ride sharing;
* Emerging technology in transportation (driverless vehicles, electric ;vehicles, autonomous vehicles, etc.);
* Advocacy responsibilities for transportation professionals;
* Youth engagement in transportation;
* The role of technology in transportation (tolls, fare collection, Uber, “the Internet of things”, big data);
* You and your career in transportation (Mentorship);
* Transit Oriented Development;
* Sustainable Transportation and Land Use;
* Road Safety; and
* …Many MORE!

This unconference is perfect for attendees who want to generate ideas, talk about topics they feel passionate about, or inspire others in the field of transportation!
