Baltimore's favorite unconference is back on October 2, with a twist. Following TranspoCampPHI's successful event, Transportation Camp will be a transit-themed scavenger hunt. Teams will compete to find spots around Baltimore, using the region's various transit modes. Prizes will be awarded to the teams who can find the most locations and score the most points!

The event will be 11am-3pm and will be followed by a Happy Hour at a location close to Penn Station.

Those who register in advance will receive a day-of playbook that will include information such as-

- What modes of transportation can I use?
- How do I navigate the city?
- How do I submit clues to earn points?
- What should I bring with me?

Join us for some transit fun as a team or solo, and we will group you with a team. All ages are welcome!
