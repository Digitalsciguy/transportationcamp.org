Transportation Camp New England 2014 is collaborating with the 37 Billion Mile Data Challenge.  This is a month-long challenge to explore anonymous vehicle-use data and discover insights that can help the Commonwealth build a model, estimated mileage, fuel efficiency of every registered vehicle in MA, as well as vehicles per household and green house gas emissions. 

Participants are encouraged to submit data-driven visualizations, infographics, maps, web tools to answer driving questions about transportation, energy, and land use. The most compelling entries will receive cash prizes, Zipcar memberships, Hubway memberships, pre-loaded Charlie Cards, and more. The submission period closes April 19,2014 and winners announced by May 1st. 

For more information on the datathon [go here](http://www.37billionmilechallenge.org). Groups involved in the datathon will be presenting their ideas at Transportation Camp New England.
