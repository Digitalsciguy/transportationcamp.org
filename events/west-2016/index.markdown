In lieu of a traditional Autumn Conference, [CalACT](https://www.calact.org/) will be holding its 2nd Transportation Camp West. Previously held in 2015 in Rohnert Park, CA, Transportation Camp West was an instant favorite among attendees in terms of conference formats. Why? Because it’s up to YOU. Attendees submit ideas for sessions, vote on ideas, and sessions are formed and discussed by on-site experts and facilitators.
This is the most interactive way to learn; topics range from transit technology to regulatory updates and advocacy advice to human resources, management, and marketing. But really – it’s up to you. If you were already planning on going to [APTA](http://www.apta.com/mc/annual/) or just want to attend this phenomenal "unconference," register today!
