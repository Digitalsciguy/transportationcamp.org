The 6th annual TransportationCamp in Washington, DC, is scheduled for Saturday, January 7, 2017.
Registration will open in the Fall.
We'll be returning to Founders Hall, in George Mason University's [Arlington Campus](http://arlington.gmu.edu/).

TransportationCamp DC happens the Saturday before the National Academy of Sciences' [Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting](http://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting/). We
attract over 400 industry thought leaders, young professionals, and students from around the country.
As an unconference, all of the sessions are created by the participants themselves.
This format fosters excellent exchange of innovative ideas in a high-energy environment.
Be a part of shaping the explosive pace of change in technology, shared use mobility, the integration of transportation and the built environment, and a host of other issues.
Bring us your ideas and lead a session!
