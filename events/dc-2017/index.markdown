The 6th annual TransportationCamp in Washington, DC, is scheduled for Saturday, January 7, 2017.
Registration will open in the Fall. We'll be returning to Founders Hall, in George Mason University's [Arlington Campus](http://arlington.gmu.edu/). Ticket prices are expected to be $45, with a limited number of student tickets at $25.

TransportationCamp DC happens the Saturday before the National Academy of Sciences' [Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting](http://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting/). We
attract over 400 industry thought leaders, young professionals, and students from around the country.
As an unconference, all of the sessions are created by the participants themselves.
This format fosters excellent exchange of innovative ideas in a high-energy environment.
Be a part of shaping the explosive pace of change in technology, shared use mobility, the integration of transportation and the built environment, and a host of other issues.
Bring us your ideas and lead a session!

We'll once again team up with the [Hays Outside the Box Competition](http://outsidethebox.gmu.edu), to be held the same day, during the final
period of TransportationCamp. Both events will be followed by a joint reception at GMU, from 6:00 to 8:00.
