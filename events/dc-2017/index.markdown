The 6th annual TransportationCamp in Washington, DC, is Saturday, January 7, 2017.
We'll be returning to Founders Hall, in George Mason University's [Arlington Campus](http://arlington.gmu.edu/).

Registration is now open: [nvite.com/transpo17](https://nvite.com/transpo17/d325). Ticket prices are $45.
Thanks to a generous grant from [AASHTO](http://www.transportation.org/),
we have a limited number of student tickets at $25 (students must register using a ".edu" email,
and must bring ID to the registration desk).
<span style="color: red; font-style: italic">[Student tickets have sold out.]</span>

TransportationCamp DC happens the Saturday before the National Academy of Sciences' [Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting](http://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting/). We
attract over 400 industry thought leaders, young professionals, and students from around the country.
As an unconference, all of the sessions are created by the participants themselves.
This format fosters excellent exchange of innovative ideas in a high-energy environment.
Be a part of shaping the explosive pace of change in technology, shared use mobility, the integration of transportation and the built environment, and a host of other issues.
Bring us your ideas and lead a session!

We'll once again team up with the [Hays Outside the Box Competition](http://outsidethebox.gmu.edu), to be held the same day,
during the final period of TransportationCamp. Both events will be followed by a joint reception at GMU. The Hays event is free, but requires its own [registration](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2017-hays-outside-the-box-conference-tickets-29304386208).
