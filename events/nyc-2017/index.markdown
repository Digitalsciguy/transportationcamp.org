##### October 21, 2017â€”NYU Tandon School of Engineering

##### Joining us for Camp today? [View the board online here!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTEKtPxGJKzL2go1h3s1AG1A0gDR2yCtA68AAiSWs_8gytc8CnhiMSYjShessGcP9Fc669EyM1f-mGG/pubhtml?gid=1321426310&single=true)

TransportationCamp NYC 2017 will foster open conversation and collaboration between all parties interested in mobility and the radical changes the near-future promises in transportation.

Our goal is to assemble planners, software developers, engineers, students, dreamers, professionals, and civic leaders for an exciting day of "un-conferencing." Unlike a traditional conference, the specific session topics are determined by participants, which provides each attendee an opportunity to lead and shape the event.

### Presenting?

Thinking about presenting at a session? Many of the breakout rooms are equipped with a projector, so if you plan to propose a session and present, please bring a laptop. We'll supply a VGA cable for Windows and have a limited supply of adapters for Macs. Most breakout rooms will also have a whiteboard.

We will be handing out session idea cards throughout registration. If you have an idea for a session, feel free to write it down in advance.
