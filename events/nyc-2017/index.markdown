##### October 21, 2017â€”NYU Tandon School of Engineering

TransportationCamp NYC 2017 will foster open conversation and collaboration between all parties interested in mobility and the radical changes the near-future promises in transportation.

Our goal is to assemble planners, software developers, engineers, students, dreamers, professionals, and civic leaders for an exciting day of "un-conferencing." Unlike a traditional conference, the specific session topics are determined by participants, which provides each attendee an opportunity to lead and shape the event.

### Registration

**[Registration for TransportationCamp NYC 2017 is open!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/transportationcamp-nyc-2017-tickets-34557142343)**

General admission is $25, and students attend FREE!

What you get for your admission:

* Full day of TransportationCamp NYC
* Breakfast, lunch, and midday refreshments at Camp
* Admission to additional events over the Camp weekend
* New friends and memories for a lifetime!

Stay tuned for details on our pre-camp events on 10/18 and 10/19 and our reception after camp to continue the conversations!

### Venue

TransportationCamp NYC will be held at NYU Tandon School of Engineering in Downtown Brooklyn. Our morning reception will be held at the Pfizer Auditorium in the Dibner Building (5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY, 11201). Afterwards, sessions will be held in Rogers Hall and the Jacobs Building, both located at 6 MetroTech Center. Camp can be accessed from Jay Street-MetroTech and Borough Hall stations (weekend track work will allow for access by the 4, 5, A, C, F, and R lines), CitiBike, numerous bus lines, and, with a short walk, the NYC Ferry DUMBO dock.
