Tompkins County and Cornell University are hosting their second
TransportationCamp Ithaca, on Saturday, June 17, 2017, 8AM-4PM, at
Klarman Hall, 232 East Avenue, on the Cornell campus.

The three primary objectives are: to offer a high quality TransportationCamp
experience in Upstate NY, to focus on challenges and solutions to medium &amp;
small urban and rural mobility, and to explore how technologies and better
practices can be used to transform peoplesâ€™ mobility choices and community
livability.

TransportationCamp fosters open conversation and collaboration between
people interested in urban and rural mobility amid radical changes in the near-
future. Camp is an opportunity to explore questions, promote new ideas and
network with fellow participants.

As an unconference, participants propose the sessions. Concurrent sessions
are then scheduled. Classrooms have internet and digital projectors. Sessions
may be facilitated or open discussions, or presentations. Be creative. This
format fosters exchange of innovative ideas in a high-energy environment. Be
a part of shaping the explosive pace of change in technology, shared use
mobility, mobility-as- a-service, TNC service models, mobility &amp; equity, social
entrepreneurship, mobility management, innovative community engagement,
and a host of other issues. Bring your ideas and lead a session!

In addition to a full day of TransportationCamp excitement, your ticket also
includes breakfast &amp; lunch. For $25 it is an amazing deal (limited number of
student tickets for $15). Early-bird discounts are available until May
