TransportationCamp attendees are submitting ideas on the Twitter [collaboration site.](http://ideas.transportationcamp.org). Some fascinating discussions are underway, and the list keeps growing. Any of those topics can become a session at Camp, if someone is willing to lead it.

Review the list and help the best topics become sessions. Leave responses and use the “support this” button to let others know what topics are hot. If something grabs your attention or gets you worked up, blog about it and post a link.

## When and where
The 3rd Annual TransportationCamp Washington DC will be held on Saturday, January 11, 2014. [Click here to register](https://transpocampdc14.eventbrite.com/).

Following on the success of [previous TransportationCamps](http://transportationcamp.org/dc/), TransportationCamp DC '14 will continue to expand the opportunities we have to improve mobility through recent advances in technology, such as web 2.0, mobile computing, open source software, open data and APIs, and spatial analysis. The conference will also examine ways to build connections between disparate innovators in public administration, transportation operations, information design, and software engineering.


The event will be on Saturday before the start of the [Transportation Research Board 93rd Annual Meeting](http://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting2014/AnnualMeeting2014.aspx).

We're excited to be hosted by the GMU School of Public Policy, at GMU Founders Hall, 3351 Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22201.

The location is easy to get to:




  * Founders Hall is located two blocks east of the Virginia Square Metro Station (Orange Line).


  * Two Capital Bikeshare stations are also within two blocks, at Virginia Square Metro and at Fairfax Dr/Wilson Blvd.


  * Metrobus 38B runs from K St, NW and Georgetown.


Here's more info including [parking and a map of the campus](http://info.gmu.edu/Maps/ArlingtonMap12.pdf).

After wrapping up the day at 5pm we will go for drinks at a location nearby, TBD.
