### Presenting?

Thinking about presenting at a session? Sessions may come in a variety of formats: informal discussions,
birds-of-a-feather, lightning talks, presentations, open space technology, and others. We welcome experts, but really
you just need to care about transportation issues or be nerds about it like us. The important thing is that you bring
your ideas and enthusiasm, and engage! Many of the breakout rooms are equipped with a projector or whiteboard. We will
be handing out **session idea cards** throughout registration. If you have an idea for a session, feel free to write it
down in advance and bring it with you to the event.

$500 scholarship sponsored by our Gold Sponsors VHB and Sam

### First Time at a TransportationCamp?

- **How To TransportationCamp:** The folks at MobilityLab have taken the time to put together
  a [TransportationCamp 101 guide](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/)
  that explains all aspects of the event.
- **Participation Encouraged:** Sessions are formed as the day goes on, so be sure to come with topics for discussion.
  If you have an idea, feel free to share and add your thoughts.
- **Rule of Two Feet:** Never hesitate to leave a session if you suddenly find it&#39;s not for you, or if there&#39;s
  another session that you want to check out, too!
