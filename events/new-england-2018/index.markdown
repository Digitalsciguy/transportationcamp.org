TransportationCamp New England is back! It’s not your traditional conference. In addition to talks and presentations from big names in the field, the heart of TransportationCamp is sessions and activities led by attendees themselves. It is a high-energy, exciting day of presentations, panels, and networking opportunities—all created and led by the diverse innovators who attend.

Join us on **Saturday, April 21st, 2018** for New Englands 4th annual camp. We will be returning to Massachusetts Institute of Technology ([MIT](http://web.mit.edu/))'s Stata Center.

Tickets are $30 for General Registration and $15 for Full-Time Students (limitted quantity) and include breakfast, lunch, snacks, and coffee! There will be a happy hour after the event. Register for the event is now open. [CLICK HERE](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/transportationcamp-new-england-2018-tickets-19295921621) to register.

### Goal

Our goal is to assemble planners, dreamers, programmers, students, and professionals for an exciting day of "un-conferencing." Unlike a traditional conference, the specific session topics are determined by participants, which provides each attendee an opportunity to lead and shape the event. Therefore, we want to see what you are doing; we want to ask how it will impact our lives; and we want to help you to find answers.


### Venue

TransportationCamp New England 2018 will be hosted on the MIT campus at the Stata Center.

> Stata Center, Main Floor<br>
> 32 Vassar Street<br>
> Cambridge, MA 02139
