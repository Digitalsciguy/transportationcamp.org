Do you consider yourself a transportation enthusiast? Do you find yourself constantly talking about Chicago’s various transportation networks? Do you bike, bus, train, walk, or drive around Chicago? Do you have any opinion on Chicago transportation in general?

If so, YPT-Chicago invites you to participate in the inaugural Transportation Camp Chicago! On **Saturday, May 5, 2018**, Chicago will join cities across America in hosting this transportation “unconference.” It’s the first one of its kind for the Windy City and will be one to remember.

Transportation Camp forgoes the traditional conference format in favor of a participant-driven discussion among industry professionals, students, and anyone interested in transportation issues and innovations. Attendees will take the lead in determining session topics and driving the conversation, so come ready to participate!

WHEN: Saturday, May 5, 2018, 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

WHERE: University of Illinois at Chicago, Student Center East, 750 S. Halsted Street.
