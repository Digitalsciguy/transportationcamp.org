It’s the perfect opportunity to share your transportation passion with a diverse gathering of fellow enthusiasts.

<h3 style="color: #FF6600;">First Time at a TransportationCamp?</h3>

- **How To TransportationCamp:** The folks at MobilityLab have taken the time to put together a [TransportationCamp 101 guide](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/) that explains all aspects of the event.
- **Participation Encouraged:** Sessions are formed as the day goes on, so be sure to come with topics for discussion. If you have an idea, feel free to share and add your thoughts.
- **Rule of Two Clicks:** Never hesitate to leave a session if you suddenly find it’s not for you, or if there’s another session that you want to check out, too!
