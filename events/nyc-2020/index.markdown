- **How To TransportationCamp:** The folks at MobilityLab have taken the time to put together a [TransportationCamp 101 guide](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/) that explains all aspects of the event.
- **Participation Encouraged:** Sessions are formed as the day goes on, so be sure to come with topics for discussion. If you have an idea, feel free to share and add your thoughts.
- **Rule of Two Clicks:** Never hesitate to leave a session if you suddenly find it&#39;s not for you, or if there&#39;s another session that you want to check out, too!
- <span style="color: red;">New!</span> **Networking sessions:** [Gather Town](https://theonline.town/) will serve as the platform for pre-event, lunch and happy hour networking.
