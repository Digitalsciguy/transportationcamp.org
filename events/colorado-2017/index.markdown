developers, data scientists, engineers, designers, entrepreneurs, students and city staff
interested in discussing and collaborating on innovative solutions to Colorado’s
transportation challenges. Interested in what was discussed last year at
TransportationCamp Colorado 2016? Browse the [session schedule and notes](https://tcampco.hackpad.com/Schedule-The-Board-xm1bw01xrtu) from some

### Sessions/Agenda

Since this is an unconference, on Saturday morning participants will be asked to submit
their ideas for sessions to lead. To speed up assembling the agenda, the week before
Camp registered attendees will be invited to submit session proposals for the first period.
This provides a unique opportunity for you to contribute to and shape the agenda. Bring
your ideas and lead a session! Find some more information about how
TransportationCamps work and how to prepare a compelling session [here](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/).

Like last year, the agenda will include one transport data show & tell session.
Attendees are invited to present an analysis, visualization or app they’ve built based on
(preferably) Colorado transport data. A sample of datasets to get you started: bikeshare
trip data from [Denver BCycle](http://denver.bcycle.com/docs/librariesprovider34/default-document-library/2016denverbcycletripdata_public.xlsx?sfvrsn=2); GTFS resources for [RTD](http://www.rtd-denver.com/Developer.shtml) and [Transfort](http://www.ridetransfort.com/developers); and city, county &
state data from [Open Colorado](http://data.opencolorado.org/) and [Colorado Information Marketplace](https://data.colorado.gov/browse?category=Transportation).
