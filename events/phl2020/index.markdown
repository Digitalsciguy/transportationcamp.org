![Scenes from TransportationCamp PHL 2019](/events/phl2018/Scenes%20from%20TCPHL18.jpg)

Whether you work in the industry or simply have an interest, we welcome you to our nation's birthplace at the center of the NEC for a day filled with ideas at the intersection of transportation, technology, and urbanism. As always, the participant-driven TransportationCamp conference series follows the "unconference" format, lending itself to a more pertinent, thought-provoking, and active event.

Organized by passionate Philadelphians in conjunction with the Philadelphia chapters of Young Professionals in Transportation (YPT) and Women’s Transportation Seminar (WTS), and Drexel University’s Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation, we look forward to seeing you! [Connect with us](#connect)

## Getting to TCPHL

We are working with our partners at the Drexel Lindy Institute to secure our venue. Historically, the conference has been located at Drexel's Papadakis Integrated Sciences Building (33rd and Chestnut Streets, less than a 10 minute walk from Philadelphia's 30th Street Station), and we plan to return for this year.

- All SEPTA Regional Rail and Amtrak trains stop at Philadelphia's 30th Street Station (four blocks away from PISB), including SEPTA's Airport Line which connects all airport terminals with 30th Street every 30 minutes.
- Megabus and Bolt Bus stop immediately outside 30th Street Station at 30th Street and JFK Blvd.
- SEPTA's Market-Frankford Elevated will get you even closer to the event (two blocks away) at the 34th Street MFL stop.
- SEPTA's Trolley Routes stop even closer – less than a block away – at 33rd Street.
- SEPTA's 30, 31, 21, and 42 buses all stop no more than a block from PISB, and the 40 is nearby, too. The 9, 44, 62, 124, and 125 buses are also accessible at 30th Street Station.
- South Jerseyans can easily connect from PATCO to the Market-Frankford Elevated at 8th & Market or walk from the NJT Atlantic City Line at 30th Street Station.

## <a name="firsttime"></a> First Time at a TransportationCamp?

- **How To TransportationCamp**: The folks at MobilityLab have taken the time to put together a [TransportationCamp 101 guide](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/) that explains all aspects of the event.
- **Participation Encouraged**: Sessions are formed as the day goes on, so be sure to come with topics for discussion. If you have an idea, feel free to share and add your thoughts. 
- **Rule of Two Feet:** Never hesitate to leave a session if you suddenly find it's not for you, or if there's another session that you want to check out, too!
- **Dress Code**: TransportationCamp is a very casual event. Although you might be inclined to dress up for a conference, your best attire is your coolest transportation tee shirt!

## Organizing Committee

TransportationCamp Philadelphia is being organized thanks to a collaborative effort between YPT, WTS, and Drexel Lindy Institute. Passionate about transportation and  bringing the conference to Philadelphia, the conference's five co-chairs span a diverse array of subsets in the industry with professional experience in both public and private transportation operations, transportation planning, and logistics consulting. For additional breadth, the conference has a larger working group whose collective knowledge and expertise spans all facets of the industry and includes all levels of transportation involvement (ranging from career professionals to engaged hobbyists).
