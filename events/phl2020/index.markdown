**Join us for the first TransportationCamp Virtual, TCPHL's response to COVID-19!**

![Scenes from TransportationCamp PHL 2019](/events/phl2018/Scenes%20from%20TCPHL18.jpg)

Whether you work in the industry or simply have an interest, we welcome you to join us online for a day filled with ideas at the intersection of transportation, technology, and urbanism. As always, the participant-driven TransportationCamp conference series follows the "unconference" format, lending itself to a more pertinent, thought-provoking, and active event.

Organized by passionate Philadelphians in conjunction with the Philadelphia chapters of Young Professionals in Transportation (YPT) and Women’s Transportation Seminar (WTS), and Drexel University’s Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation, we look forward to seeing you… so clean off that webcam!

This will be a free event, but we're asking participants to register in advance, especially given the uncharted waters of a virtual unconference. Logistics will be updated on an ongoing basis, so register for the event and [subscribe to email updates to ensure you get the latest](#connect).

## Getting to TCVirtual

TransportationCamp Virtual will be an online event hosted through a videoconferencing platform. Exact details will be shared in the future, so be sure to register for the event and subscribe for email updates.


## <a name="firsttime"></a> First Time at a TransportationCamp?

- **How To TransportationCamp**: The folks at MobilityLab have taken the time to put together a [TransportationCamp 101 guide](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/) that explains all aspects of the event.
- **Participation Encouraged**: Sessions are formed as the day goes on, so be sure to come with topics for discussion. If you have an idea, feel free to share and add your thoughts. 
- **Rule of Two <s>Feet</s> Clicks:** Never hesitate to leave a session if you suddenly find it's not for you, or if there's another session that you want to check out, too!
- **Dress Code**: TransportationCamp is a very casual event, especially via the virtual platform. Although you might be inclined to dress up for a conference, your best attire is your coolest transportation tee shirt!

## Organizing Committee

TransportationCamp Philadelphia is being organized thanks to a collaborative effort between YPT, WTS, and Drexel Lindy Institute. Passionate about transportation and  bringing the conference to Philadelphia, the conference's five co-chairs span a diverse array of subsets in the industry with professional experience in both public and private transportation operations, transportation planning, and logistics consulting. For additional breadth, the conference has a larger working group whose collective knowledge and expertise spans all facets of the industry and includes all levels of transportation involvement (ranging from career professionals to engaged hobbyists).


## <a name="scholarship"></a> Deferred to 2021: The TCPHL Academic Innovation Award

TransportationCamp PHL was pleased to launch the **2020 TransportationCamp PHL Academic Innovation Award presented by David Klahr Consulting**! This award, the first of its kind for a TransportationCamp, challenged students to prepare a response to the following prompt:

> *Transportation networks are becoming increasingly integrated, with multimodal journeys representing a much larger portion of individual mode choice. Some modes provide robust interoperability in payment systems, such as EZ Pass which can be used by an automobile anywhere in the Northeast. Others, such as transit systems, are typically restricted by mode and operator (e.g. SEPTA Key), limiting integration with counterpart networks.*
> 
> *What can the Philadelphia region do right now with existing real-world systems and resources to make this work better?  What actionable changes would you implement in this region, and why? How would these changes promote integrated mobility solutions?*

Updates will be made prior to the award's issuance in 2021. Submissions must be in PDF format, no longer than 10 pages (including any pictures/graphs/charts), and submitted no later than March 14, 2020 at [this site](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSch14g_2RnTaq1cdmHLVbTJcFA3ozxlnGeQwKfm_ec-OPLT2w/viewform). **The winner shall receive the award, free admission to the conference, and a generous $500 scholarship!**
