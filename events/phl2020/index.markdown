**Join us for the first TransportationCamp Virtual, TCPHL's response to COVID-19!**

> # If you are a registered attendee, please check the email at which you registered for connection details.

Whether you work in the industry or simply have an interest, we welcome you to join us online for a day filled with ideas at the intersection of transportation, technology, and urbanism.

This is not your normal conference. **And it's NOT some webinars on a Saturday.**

As always, the participant-driven TransportationCamp conference series follows the "unconference" format, lending itself to a more pertinent, thought-provoking, and active event. And despite the virtual constraints, we've spent a considerable amount of time to keep the experience as close to the in-person event as possible.

- Enjoy conversing with new connections over breakfast and lunch at virtual "tables."
- Sessions will remain interactive conversations, so clean off your webcam!
- In keeping with the conference tradition, meet fellow attendees during "three-word intros."
- Help shape the day by proposing a session, conversation, or gathering when joining us for the event.
- After the sessions, keep the conversations going with new connections by gathering in a virtual room.

Organized by passionate Philadelphians in conjunction with the Philadelphia chapters of Young Professionals in Transportation (YPT) and Women’s Transportation Seminar (WTS), and Drexel University’s Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation, we look forward to seeing you… via your webcam.

## TCVirtual Logistics

TransportationCamp Virtual will be a live, real-time event happening on April 25. 

The conference shall comprise of two main areas: session "rooms" and an open seating area with "tables." Much like how one would navigate an in-person conference (having coffee at a table, going to a room for each session, having lunch at a table with others, etc.), attendees of TCVirtual will do the same… the difference being the rooms and tables will each be a distinct videoconference meeting room.

The programming has been specifically structured to accommodate the virtual event, and we think it will flow fairly seamlessly. Specific details and links will be shared with registered attendees, so make sure to register for the event.

If interested, please contact us at [transportationcampphl@gmail.com](mailto:transportationcampphl@gmail.com).

## <a name="firsttime"></a> First Time at a TransportationCamp?

Despite being virtual, this event will still follow the standard guidelines and practices from a normal TransportationCamp event. Here are some details.

- **How To TransportationCamp**: The folks at MobilityLab have taken the time to put together a [TransportationCamp 101 guide](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/) that explains all aspects of the event.
- **Participation Encouraged**: Sessions are formed as the day goes on, so be sure to come with topics for discussion. If you have an idea, feel free to share and add your thoughts. 
- **Rule of Two <s>Feet</s> Clicks:** Never hesitate to leave a session if you suddenly find it's not for you, or if there's another session that you want to check out, too!
- **Dress Code**: TransportationCamp has always been a very casual event, especially via the virtual format. We've always said, your best attire is your coolest transportation tee shirt!

Want a better sense of the vibe? Check out last year's [photo gallery](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmhQCQbL) and [session schedule](https://tinyurl.com/tcphl19board) and from our inaugural year ([2018 Photos](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmhQCQbL), [2018 Sessions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSmc891MrEUuYGkoGbz-4xh_KUo5YVFy4M_eoyKvjtv0GVM2dgBzDDEioXKhmHD_PGFz1jvsELOD9E8/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true)).


## Organizing Committee

TransportationCamp Philadelphia is being organized thanks to a collaborative effort between YPT, WTS, and Drexel Lindy Institute. Passionate about transportation and  bringing the conference to Philadelphia, the conference's five co-chairs span a diverse array of subsets in the industry with professional experience in both public and private transportation operations, transportation planning, and logistics consulting. For additional breadth, the conference has a larger working group whose collective knowledge and expertise spans all facets of the industry and includes all levels of transportation involvement (ranging from career professionals to engaged hobbyists).

### *<a name="scholarship"></a> Deferred to 2021: The TCPHL Academic Innovation Award*

TransportationCamp PHL was pleased to launch the **2020 TransportationCamp PHL Academic Innovation Award presented by David Klahr Consulting**! This award, the first of its kind for a TransportationCamp, challenged students to prepare a response to the following prompt:

> *Transportation networks are becoming increasingly integrated, with multimodal journeys representing a much larger portion of individual mode choice. Some modes provide robust interoperability in payment systems, such as EZ Pass which can be used by an automobile anywhere in the Northeast. Others, such as transit systems, are typically restricted by mode and operator (e.g. SEPTA Key), limiting integration with counterpart networks.*
> 
> *What can the Philadelphia region do right now with existing real-world systems and resources to make this work better?  What actionable changes would you implement in this region, and why? How would these changes promote integrated mobility solutions?*

Updates will be made prior to the award's issuance in 2021. Submissions must be in PDF format, no longer than 10 pages (including any pictures/graphs/charts), and submitted no later than March 14, 2020 at [this site](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSch14g_2RnTaq1cdmHLVbTJcFA3ozxlnGeQwKfm_ec-OPLT2w/viewform). **The winner shall receive the award, free admission to the conference, and a generous $500 scholarship!**
