Save the date! TransportationCamp DC 2020 will be **Saturday, January 11, 2020**.

A tradition since 2012, TransportationCamp DC is held on the Saturday before the
[Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting](http://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting).

Founded by [OpenPlans](https://openplans.org/), TransportationCamp debuted in New York City in 2011.
In October 2014, the baton was passed to [Mobility Lab](https://mobilitylab.org/), which shepherded the event for five years.
For 2020, the baton is in the hands of [Transportation for America](http://t4america.org/).

Stay tuned to [@transpocamp](https://twitter.com/transpocamp) for announcements about the venue and registration.
