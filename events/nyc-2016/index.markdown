After a successful re-launch of TransportationCamp NYC last year, we are looking forward to an even bigger, better event this September! TransportationCamp brings together thinkers and doers in the fields of transportation and technology. This is not your traditional conference. In addition to talks and presentations from big names in the field, the heart of TransportationCamp is sessions and activities suggested by attendees themselves. It all takes place Saturday, September 24, 2016, at the [City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/).

Registration opens in June, and we look forward to seeing you in September!
