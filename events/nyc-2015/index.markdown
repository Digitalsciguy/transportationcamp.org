Do you love transportation? Do you love New York City? 
TransportationCamp New York City 2015 will be held on Saturday, November 14, 2015 at 
[City College of New York](http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/). Following on the success 
of [TransportationCamp East in 2011](http://transportationcamp.org/events/east/), [Planning Camp](http://planningcamp.org/) NYC in 2013 and 
TransportationCamps across the country, we're bringing it back to New York City. 
TransportationCamp NYC 2015 will continue to foster open conversation and collaboration between all parties 
interested in mobility and the radical changes the near-future promises in transportation.

## Goal

Our goal is to assemble planners, software developers, engineers, students, dreamers, and professionals for an 
exciting day of "un-conferencing." 
Unlike a traditional conference, the specific session topics are determined by participants, 
which provides each attendee an opportunity to lead and shape the event. 
Therefore, we want to see what you are doing; we want to ask how it will impact our lives; 
and we want to help you to find answers.

## Venue

Transportation Camp NYC will be held at City College of New York in Shepard Hall (160 Convent Avenue New York, NY 10031 - At the intersection of Convent Avenue and W 140th st, close to the 1, B, and C Trains)
