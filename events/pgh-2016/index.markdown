If you’re into transportation, now’s the time to engage, and the TransportationCamp PGH unconference is the place to do it.  Bring your ideas and lead a session! Be a part of shaping the explosive pace of change in technology, shared use mobility, the integration of transportation and the built environment, and a host of other issues. Join us November 19, and watch this space for updates. Welcome to the Burgh!

### What is an unconference?
An unconference is when people that attend determine the sessions.  

### How does this happen?  
Attendees take post it notes and write what they want to talk about/discuss on THE WALL. All the topics are then grouped together and determine the sessions based on all the inputs.  It’s analog crowdsourcing.  

### How it’s different from a regular conference
Instead of the conference host deciding what’s important, the attendees decide.  Plus each session is a conversation, not talking heads.  Attendees get access to the people they want to have discussions with right in the session and get to open it up to a room of people, rather than waiting in line after a “talk” and exchanging a few sentences. Furthermore, it’s localized.  There are a lot of issues/ideas that will bubble up that are unique to Pittsburgh.   Our hope is that planners/practitioners/politicians/engineers/thinkers/students/ordinary people can have meaningful discussions about Pittsburgh and its regional transportation system and its future.

### Documentation and follow up
There is a real-time, cloud based "white board," if you will, and all the notes from each session are crowdsourced and documented.  People can share their contact info and follow up with each other.  Check out DC’s Transpo Camp early this year: [transportationcamp.org/events/dc-2016/schedule.html](http://transportationcamp.org/events/dc-2016/schedule.html).

At **TransportationCamp PGH**, all possibilities about the future of mobility are up for grabs, and your ideas will power the conversation. From big to small, train to bike lane to app - come share with like-minded, leading thinkers and doers who are revolutionizing the transportation field here in Western PA. Who knows, maybe you’ll even find some new friends to move your idea forward.
