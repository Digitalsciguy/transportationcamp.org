<img src="cmu.jpg" style="float:right;width:136px;height:136px;">If you’re into transportation, now’s the time to engage, and the TransportationCamp PGH unconference is the place to do it.

At **TransportationCamp PGH**, possibilities about future mobility are up for grabs, and your ideas will power the conversation. Big and small - from train to bike lane to app - come share with like-minded, leading thinkers and doers who are revolutionizing the transportation field.  Maybe you’ll even find some new friends to move your idea forward.

As an unconference, all of the sessions are created by you - the participants. This format fosters innovative idea exchanges in a high-energy environment.

We welcome [National League of Cities](http://www.nlc.org/)’ [City Summit](http://citysummit.nlc.org/) 2016 attendees to continue their transportation discussions at TransportationCampPGH.  The event takes place on November 19 at Carnegie Mellon University’s Hamburg Hall.

Bring your ideas and lead a session! Be a part of shaping the explosive pace of change in technology, shared use mobility, the integration of transportation and the built environment, and a host of other issues. Join us November 19, and watch this space for updates.
