If you’re into transportation, now’s the time to engage, and the TransportationCampPGH unconference November 14 is the
place to do it. COVID-19 and reinvigorated racial justice movements have disrupted the transportation status quo,
forever changing the sector. Recent technology advances present an opportunity to improve mobility more immediately than
has ever been possible, but resilient public transit and walkable communities are vital if new modes are to be
equitable. We know that you have thoughts about this, how transportation can be better, and TransportationCampPGH is
your place to bring them. All possibilities about the future of mobility are up for grabs, and your ideas - big and
small - will power the conversation. Come share with like-minded, leading thinkers and doers who are revolutionizing the
transportation field here in Western PA. Who knows? Maybe you’ll even find some new friends to move your idea forward.

### What is an unconference?
An unconference is really a people-powered event. You come up with the session topics. We then group them together and
determine the sessions based on all the inputs. Then, we post them with links to virtual rooms, and people join the ones
that interest them the most.

### How prepared do I need to be?
As much as you want, but not very! Each session is a conversation, not talking heads. Sessions range from informal
discussions to full-blown presentations.  It’s really up to you.
