*Sunday, June 10*
9 a.m.-4 p.m.

*Location* [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), Cohon University Center, second floor. Cohon University Center located at []#14 on the this campus map](https://www.cmu.edu/assets/pdfs/cmu_map_8.5x11.pdf). Parking is free on weekends at the adjacent East Campus Garage, located at P7 on the campus map.

Join us at TransportationCamp Pittsburgh on June 10 at the campus of Carnegie Mellon University for deep discussions about improving our transportation networks wherever we are, whether that means new or expanded service, accessibility, autonomous ridehailing, shuttles or buses, complete streets, or transportation equity. Join us at 9 a.m. for roll call at the flagpole. Oh wait, that's regular camp. We'll be sipping coffee and talking multiple modes. TransportationCamp is a one-day un-conference where attendees suggest and lead sessions and activities. There are no panels and no keynote speakers. Beware: This is not a regular camp. There is no lake, no bunk beds, no duffel bags, no bad food, and no bug juice. TransportationCamp brings together thinkers and doers in the fields of transportation, planning, and technology.

*Fee*: $50; $25 for students (with a valid student ID). Breakfast and lunch will be served.
