[Young Professionals in Transportation](http://yptbaltimore.org/) is
bringing Transportation Camp to Baltimore!

Saturday, May 12th @ [University of Baltimore School of Business](http://www.ubalt.edu/merrick/).

Bringing Transportation Camp to Baltimore will bring a
more inclusive and engaging forum about transportation to the
professionals, techies, advocates, policy makers, and users of
transportation in the Baltimore Region. This event brings Baltimore
into an international family of cities holding Camps every year and
highlighting transportation’s impact on every aspect of people’s
lives: equity, education, jobs, economic development, recreation,
sustainability, and overall access to opportunity.
