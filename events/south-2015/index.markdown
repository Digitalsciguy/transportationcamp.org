TransportationCamp South returns to Atlanta on Saturday, September 26th, 2015. 

TransportationCamp is an “unconference” – where sessions are proposed and led by attendees – bringing together thinkers and doers in the fields of transportation and technology for a day of learning, debating, connecting, and creating. Created by [OpenPlans](http://openplans.org/) in 2011, this will be the 3rd TransportationCamp South (others have been held in New York, Washington, San Francisco, Montreal, and Boston), following on the success of previous events in 2013 and 2014. For coverage of past year's events, see [the writeup in Creative Loafing](http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2013/02/13/transportationcamp-south-is-a-wonks-heaven) ("TransportationCamp South a Wonk's Heaven") and the [photo gallery on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.158375964315742.35811.138477536305585&type=3).

##  Why Transportation?

Transportation is a major metropolitan issue, with direct impacts on economic strength, environmental sustainability, and social equity. Recent advances in technology (mobile computing, open source software, open data, and spatial analysis) present an opportunity to improve mobility more immediately and at a lower cost than has ever been possible in the past. Transportation policy is no longer necessarily a top-down process. Now more than ever, there are opportunities for a bottom-up approach that focuses on the experience and needs of the citizens themselves. 

## What's an "Unconference?"?

This is not a traditional conference. The organizers don't pick a set of panels and panelists ahead of time. Instead, you organize the panels! Anyone interested in talking about an issue can organize a session, and attendees just go to the sessions they're most interested in. For more information on how TransportationCamp works, read the [Essential Guide](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/).

## Schedule & Venue

The event program will run from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM on Saturday, September 26, 2015, with breakfast/registration from 8:30 to 9:30. A light breakfast, box lunch, and coffee breaks will be provided for all participants and are included in the $10 registration fee. There is also a Starbucks located on-site.

The venue for TransportationCamp South will be the [Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons](http://clough.gatech.edu/), a state-of-the-art, sustainably-designed educational facility located at the heart of the Georgia Tech campus.
