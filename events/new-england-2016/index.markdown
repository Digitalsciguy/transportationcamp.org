The 3rd Annual TransportationCamp New England will be held on Saturday, April 9, 2016. 

Following on the success of last year's event, TransportationCamp New England 2016 will continue to foster open conversation and collaboration between all parties interested in mobility and the radical changes the near-future promises in transportation.

Our goal is to assemble planners, dreamers, programmers, students, and professionals for an exciting day of "un-conferencing." Unlike a traditional conference, the specific session topics are determined by participants, which provides each attendee an opportunity to lead and shape the event. Therefore, we want to see what you are doing; we want to ask how it will impact our lives; and we want to help you to find answers.

Some of this yearâ€™s session topics will included:

* Bike share applications and technology
* Open source data and standards
* Impacts of autonomous and connected vehicles
* Drones, current applications and future implications
* The science behind Hyperloop -the conceptual high-speed transportation system
* Making data matter
* Improving mobility in Boston (and beyond!)
* Transformative trends in transportation
