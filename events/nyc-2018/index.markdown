##### October 13, 2018—NYU Tandon School of Engineering

## Joining us today? View the board online at [bit.ly/tcnyc18](https://bit.ly/tcnyc18)!

TransportationCamp NYC 2018 will foster open conversation and collaboration in mobility and the radical changes the present is experiencing in transportation globally - in cities and between them.

TransportationCamp continues to assemble planners, software developers, engineers, students, dreamers, professionals, and civic leaders for an exciting day of "un-conferencing” and planned gatherings in the week before it. All of these events will connect those across the transportation industry in an open and safe space for dialogue.

Unlike a traditional conference, the specific session topics are determined by participants, which provides each attendee an opportunity to lead and shape the event!

TransportationCamp NYC 2018 will be held at NYU Tandon School of Engineering in Downtown Brooklyn. Camp can be accessed from Jay Street - MetroTech and Borough Hall stations, CitiBike, numerous bus lines, and, with a short walk, the NYC Ferry DUMBO dock.
